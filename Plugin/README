- Due to the nature of plugins, there's more here than for most other tools in
  our toolbox.  Here's a directory breakdown:

  - Common
    - All pre-compiled plugins in an 'Interface/Plugin.so' structure
  - Implementation
    - All common plugin source files in an 'Interface/Plugin.cpp' structure
  - Interface 
    - All common plugin interfaces .hpp files (the includes for projects)
  - example
    - A simple plugin example showing proper usage of the Plugin tool

- In the Implementation directory is a plugin build script for the common
  plugins, conveniently called: build_plugins.sh  This script builds each of
  the plugins and places the result in the Common directory.

- This one tool nearly "violates" the notion of this library being
  header-only, since it has pre-compiled parts...  But due to their nature as
  plugins, these parts are purely optional.  Having some of the more commonly
  used, generic plugins in a central location far outweighs this "issue".
