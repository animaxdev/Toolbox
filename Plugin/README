- Due to the nature of plugins, there's more here than for most other tools in
  our toolbox.  Here's a directory breakdown:

  - Common
    - Plugin source implementations that are commonly used (within the Toolbox
      or otherwise)
    - A build_plugins.sh script to build each of these common plugins
      (assuming dependencies are met -- not automatic, but they should be
       relatively easy to find/install)
    - The plugins built by build_plugins.sh will end up in this location also

  - example
    - A simple plugin example showing proper usage of the Plugin tool

- This one tool nearly "violates" the notion of this library being
  header-only, since it has pre-compiled parts...  But due to their nature as
  plugins, these parts are purely optional.  Having some of the more commonly
  used, generic plugins in a central location far outweighs this "issue".
