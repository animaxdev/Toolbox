- Due to the nature of plugins, there's more here than for most other tools in
  our toolbox.  Here's a directory breakdown:

  - example
    - A simple plugin example showing proper usage of the Plugin tool

  - <Plugin Name> Directories (Everything Else)
    - Each directory contains an example implementation within a single cpp
      file.
    - The build_plugins.sh script will dive into each directory and build each
      *.cpp file as a plugin (*.so).  (TODO: Improve this process.)

- This one tool nearly "violates" the notion of this library being
  header-only, since it has pre-compiled parts...  But due to their nature as
  plugins, these parts are purely optional.  Having some of the more commonly
  used, generic plugins in a central location far outweighs this "issue".
