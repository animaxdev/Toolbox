------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- "Installation" is simple -- Copy this directory (or create a symlink to it)
  in your /usr/local/include directory.

- Most tools in this toolbox are designed to be stand-alone, include-only
  libraries.  However, there are some that require a plugin implementation to
  function as-expected (if this is the case, this is noted in the notes
  section along with additional instructions).

- All documentation is included directly within each source file.

- Example code may be found within some "example" directories within or within
  the source documentation.
